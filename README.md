# Independent Project: Event Page
The purpose of this final project is to create something brand new that incorporates all of the skills you've built over the course of the semester. The focus of this assignment is responsive design, use of imagery, and the user experience.

## Brief
Create a website (only needs to be one page) for a stand-alone event. Create, invent or identify an event that would warrant its own website (rather than a webpage embedded within an existing site) like an encounter with an alien, a conference, a lecture or performance series, an arts festival, or day of action.

If the event requires purchasing tickets, registering or signing up you only need to create the anchor that would lead to that page (like a "sign up" or "register" button) and not the actual sign-up user flow. Keep it simple, don't add pages unless you need them. Optional pages include: about (about.html), contact (contact.html), error (404.html). 

Please review the assignment sheet on Blackboard for all requirements.
